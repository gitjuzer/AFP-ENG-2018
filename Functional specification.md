Team of developers already divided tasks, so each of us has their own job to do.
We have additional developer, that joined our team on 14th of Nov 2018.
List of the tasks, which are done:

1. Requirement specification: Dream Chapter.
2. Requirement specification: Current Specification.
3. Requirement specification: Requirements List.
4. Requirement specification: Laws and standards.


# Constraints on the system
As per said in the requirement specification, the software must oblige the new requlations in the EU, namely *GDPR*. This means whatever data we collect from the user, must be treated with the utmost care. Also the user **MUST** explicitly accept the collection and use of his/her data.

As stated in the requirement specification, copyright content can be used for educational purposes. Although it varies country-by-country, if the original author/source must be stated or not. This would mean a great constraint on the system in case of commercialising the software. In case of free educational software, the differences between the countries does no concern us, we will only have to oblige to the laws in the country, where our organization is stated, and where the original source of the server side of the software is. Even if CDN is used, the original source is the one we have to oblige.
