# Current Situations  
Mobile computing is the future of business. Smartphone and tablet sales are on the rise and businesses are finally jumping on board. However, choosing the right path is a challenging task for business just stepping out into mobile territory. If you wish to create mobile apps for your business, you have two options: Create native apps or mobile web apps. The decision largely hinges on your company’s needs. 
To summarize the information detailed above, here are 5 important factors that will impact your mobile application decision:
1. If you want apps that work across multiple platforms, mobile web apps are a better option. 
2. If you want apps that access the device’s camera or microphone, native apps are a better option. 
3. If security is important, mobile web apps are a better option. 
4. If you want to sell your apps, native apps are a better option. 
5. If you want apps that integrate with existing systems and databases, mobile web apps are a better option.
