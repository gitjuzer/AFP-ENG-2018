4.Goal

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to build an education based game that will be interactive and stimulation to the user. 

Intended Audience

This is aimed to the 4 types of game players. Namely :

1.Achiever : accumulate status tokens by beating the rules-based challenges of the game world
2.Killers: interfere with the functioning of the game world or the play experience of other players
3.Explorers: discover the systems governing the operation of the game world
4.Socializers: form relationships with other players by telling stories within the game world

These four styles emerged from the combination of two primary gameplay interests, which I've called Content and Control, each of which has two mutually exclusive forms. Content is defined to mean either acting simply and directly on objects in the game world, or interacting more deeply with world-systems. Control refers to how players want to experience the game world -- either through the dynamic behaviors of other players, or with the relatively static world of the game itself.

Project Ouline

Play 
Children are great at playing. It is how they learn to avoid dangers and live in
our community. The best approach to surviving different situations is to imagine
them beforehand and play them out with or without our friends and using toys
as representations of objects. We grownups just have a different name for it:
simulation. What sets simulation and play apart is that play is associated with
fun and simulation with work. 

Pretending 
Players of a game agree to a certain level of pretension, this is often referred as
the “magic circle”. The magic circle sets the boundary between ideas and
activities that are meaningful in the game from those that are meaningful in the
real world. 
 
Rules 
Rules are created in advance by a game designer and rarely change
significantly during the game. Every player must accept the rules before starting
the game 

Meaningful play
Meaningful play in a game emerges from the relationship between player action
and system outcome; it is the process by which a player takes action within the
designed system of a game and the system responds to the action.

Goal
The goal is to maximize enjoyment and engagement through capturing the interest of learners and inspiring them to continue learning.

# Current Situations  
Mobile computing is the future of business. Smartphone and tablet sales are on the rise and businesses are finally jumping on board. However, choosing the right path is a challenging task for business just stepping out into mobile territory. If you wish to create mobile apps for your business, you have two options: Create native apps or mobile web apps. The decision largely hinges on your company’s needs. 
To summarize the information detailed above, here are 5 important factors that will impact your mobile application decision:
1. If you want apps that work across multiple platforms, mobile web apps are a better option. 
2. If you want apps that access the device’s camera or microphone, native apps are a better option. 
3. If security is important, mobile web apps are a better option. 
4. If you want to sell your apps, native apps are a better option. 
5. If you want apps that integrate with existing systems and databases, mobile web apps are a better option. 
If your company plans on creating mobile apps this year, those factors will help guide your planning. Remember, mobile computing is the future of business.
